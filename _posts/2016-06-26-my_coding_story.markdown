        My First introduction to coding was using HTML to make a basic webpage in A fourth grade computer class. The webapage was a basic profile page with a some infromation about myself and a picture ,now that i think of it was pretty far before its time because this was way before social media. Everyone in the class made the same basic page and we  werent really told that this could be a career, it just seemed like something we had to get done. My next experience with coding came much later on in highschool when I took a C+ class in which I built a hangman game. I really enjoyed the class and the teacher was really great at helping us learn but like the Fourth grade HTML lesson I didnt realize that it could be possible for me to learn so much more about coding.The way that I thought of it was this is a class I have to take yes I enjoyed it but it would probable be way to difficult to learn enough to have this be a viable career.
                
        I have always been into tech and reading about new technology , so one day while reading a tech blog I came across this website codecademy , which I think alot of coders got there start on. The most important thing I learned on coding wasnt necessarily coding but the fact that it was possible for me to learn to code. After using codeacademy for a few months I realized even though I was learning alot I was using there interface as a crutch and I found it diffcult to code without its constant guidance. 
                
       I came to the conclusion that the best way to learn was by doing.I picked up some programming books and started little projects. The next problem was what language do I stick to this whole time I had been coding with java than I jumped to JavaScript . I was also learning python also because I had a raspberry pi that I had been playing around with. While do this was buliding many small mock websites with HTML and CSS which I really enjoyed because i was able to get to see what I was making as I built it.
              
      Finding guidance was the next step I needed. I was jumping around way to much decided and I need to find some type of program to give me the steps which I needed to become a better programmer. Looking around I discovered programming bootcamps ,one which I was really interested in was Flatiron school but it would be impossible for me too go to a full time bootcamp and continue my day job. I signed up for the flatiron schools newsletter and trying to find a way to make time for a full time bootcamp when I recieved the email from Flatiron school about there new online class Learn Verified and there free intro class and jumped at the chance to take it. I found myself learning so much so quickly in short intro class in which you had to build a Tic Tac Toe game. I loved the learn by doing approach that the lessons had . I than deceide to apply for the full class , I was accepeted and now brings me here now a Learn Verfied student looking foward to continuing my coding story.
